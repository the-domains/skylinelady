# Happy Valentine's Day

Whether you're in a relationship or
single V-Day has the advantage to say "I love you" to those people who are really important to us. And you don't even have to be in a
relationship. Basically, you can do it at each x-any day to day your loved once, so
why not on V-Day. All couples are looking forward to this day, especially the
florists, finally again give the partners a small but fine attention. And what
about the singles? They wished it were not that day, until the day they found the right partner. But hey love singles, does make a girls day or a
day of friends from this now globally extended day of love. In every situation
there is a way to align it to your own needs. I used the day to
send a message my sweethearts to tell them in a really short message that I love them. Not only to my dearest friends, also to
my family celebrating the V-Day, because we then spread out LOVE into
the world, so that special commercial thoughtag uses your loved ones your
reveal. That's why we should spread love!  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4b4202fc-efe4-458d-bec9-612cf7d42fa1.jpg)
