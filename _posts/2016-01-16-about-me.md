# About Me

Hi, my name is Caroline. I am working around the globe as a Freelance Marketing Communications Consultant.

My passion is to travel, which I express in this blog. Whether by foot, bike, train, ship or plane, I love to explore places, to eat and to be in dialogue with the people around me. In my self-employed activity my network plays an important role and this is also quite beneficial when I am traveling around the globe. 

There is still a lot to discover in this world.

Be curious and stay tuned on my next travelogue.
