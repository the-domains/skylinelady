# About Me

Hi, my name is Caroline. I am working around the globe as a Freelance Marketing Communications Consultant.

I am a curious, inquisitive freelancer who cares about the world we live in. My passion is to travel, which I express in this blog. Whether by foot, bike, train, boat or plane, I love to explore places, to eat and to be in dialogue with the people around me.

> There is still a lot to discover in this world.

I post here English and German contributions - almost bilingual.

Be curious and stay tuned on my next travelogue.
