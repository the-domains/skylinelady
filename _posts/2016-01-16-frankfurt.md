# Travel Europe

## Frankfurt

As a resident of Frankfurt I know accordingly many places, but also discover constantly new places. The current construction boom also changes the infrastructure. But it is also not unusual that new stores open and others close. 

I have created you in [Foursquare][0] a list of my favorite places and update these regularly.

This site is under construction at the moment - more coming soon.
