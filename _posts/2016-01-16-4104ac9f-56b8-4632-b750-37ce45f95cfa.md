![2015 my year of travel brings many changes for me. And today you get my 1st #selfie! Do you want more? Say yay or nay!  (hier: Morton Street)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/92e0c2cd81f96918225467e59a669528e4f4140d.jpg)

# Than it began in 2015

**In January 2015 I started documenting my journeys. And a year later, in January 2016 I have launched my blog.** Everything opens up incredible. And that is pretty awesome - so you can imagine how grateful I am.

In addition to travel, the photography is a another great passion of mine. I also dared to show myself for the first time, because I'm away from the invisible user thoughts. 

I'll tell you about my journeys and show things that impress me, give me inspiration and which make me laugh. I hope you enjoy with my blog.
