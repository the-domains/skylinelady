In January 2015 I started documenting my travels. In addition to travel, the photograph is a great passion of mine. I also dared to show myself and I'm away from the user invisible thoughts.
A year later, in January 2016 and I have created my blog. It opens up incredible. And that I think is great, because there is nothing worse than stagnation and tediousness. I'll tell you about my journeys and show things that impress me, give me inspiration and which make me laugh. I hope you enjoy with my blog.
![2015 my year of travel brings many changes for me. And today you get my 1st #selfie! Do you want more? Say yay or nay!  (hier: Morton Street)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b34e88d841d574a149e7716e5d274cf3198b737e.jpg)
