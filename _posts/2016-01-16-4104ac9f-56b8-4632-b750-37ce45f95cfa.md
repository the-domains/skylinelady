# Where it started

In January 2015 I started documenting my journey. 

In addition to travel, the photography is a another great passion of mine. I also dared to show myself for the first time, because I'm away from the invisible user thoughts.  

And a year later, in January 2016 I have created my blog. It opens up incredible. And that I think is great, because there is nothing worse than stagnation and tediousness. 

I'll tell you about my journeys and show things that impress me, give me inspiration and which make me laugh. I hope you enjoy with my blog.
![2015 my year of travel brings many changes for me. And today you get my 1st #selfie! Do you want more? Say yay or nay!  (hier: Morton Street)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ab1da14136f69e534fbcab40833ae5748f47fb4b.jpg)
